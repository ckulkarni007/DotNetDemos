OOps

Realtime eg. (human world)

Class - 
What is a class (State and behaviour)
Purpose of a constructor, Types - private, parameterized, copy,default and static
Overloading of class constructor
Understanding of this keyword
Destructor
partial classes - asp.net autocode generation, EF code generation, better maintance, parallel development
sealed classes - security, singleton

Static and Instance Class Members - (static vars can be changed by any instance which is not good)
Static members
Instance members
Difference
Example

Inheritance - 
Why - Code reuse
Constructor Instantiation - Base first then child
Child classes are the specialization of the base
Single inheritance is possible
Why multi is not possible (same methods/properties present in both the parent then child gets confuse which one to take)

Polymorphism-
Overloading
hiding - refernce type
Overriding - instance type

Encapsulation (Its about who is in control)
- Data hiding
- Increased flexibility as readonly or writeonly
- Code testability and reusability
- Eg. USB port in mobile

Abstraction
- Interfaces (Implicit and explicit) - Inherit from another interface
- Abstract classes
-
