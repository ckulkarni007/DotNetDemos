.Net Fundamentals


Compilation - 2 step 
			1. Language compilers (language - MSIL intermediate lang (dll /.exe))
			2. JIT (MSIL to binary)
CLR Elements - 

1.  CLS - Common Language Specification 
	Nothing but MSIL - Base ruleset that all languages has to follow if u r building on top of .net

2.  CTS - Common Type System (value and reference)
	- Specifies how types declared, used and managed
	- Cross-language integration, type safety, high performance


3.	Garbage Collection - 
	Managed Memory
	- Memory types - Heap and stack

	- Called in case when - low physical memory indication by OS
						- memory in managed heap surpases the threshold
						- GC.Collect is called explicitly by user
	- Generations - 0 - Short lived
				  - 1 - Short lived
				  - 2 - Long lived 
				  Survival and promotions
	GC by default cleans up managed code. It does not clean Unmanaged code(DB Connection, I/O file handlers etc)
 	Finalize() - non explicit and Dispose - explicit - For Unmanaged Code

4 JIT Compiler - Pre (everything at the start itself)
			   - Econo (removes once used)
			   - Normal (Caching)
	How it compiles - 
		- Per File
		- Per Method
		- Code Fragment
