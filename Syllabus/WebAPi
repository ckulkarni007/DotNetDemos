Web API 

WCF - cross protocol support. Single service can serve 2 clients java n .net with different protocols like FTP n HTTP.


REST Constraints -
- ClientServer
- Stateless
- Cacheable - (for the data which is not changable over a period of time, performance improv.)
- Uniform Interface (Resource - dataentities,)
- 

Evolution of API - (initially there were different methods exposed for individual operation)
Then HTTP evolution (GET, POST, PUT etc.)

POST: take this data and apply it to the resource identified by the given URI, following the rules you documented for the resource media type.

PUT: replace whatever is identified by the given URI with this data, ignoring whatever is in there already, if anything.

PATCH: if the resource identified by the given URI still has the same state it had the last time I looked, apply this diff to it.


Web API Pipeline 
( low level handler and Controller pipeline)
1. Request Delegate Handlers - Global
							 - Per Route
2. HttpRouteDispatcher  
3. HttpControllerDispatcher - Final Stop
4. Controller Selector, Activator
5. ApiController - HttpActionSelectior, descriptor (to decide the actions to be picked up)
6. Filters - Types  - Authentication
					- Autherization
					- Action
					- Exception
